        FINDINGS: Single AP portable view of the chest. No prior. The lungs are clear of large confluent consolidation. Cardiac silhouette enlarged but could be accentuated by positioning and relatively low inspiratory effort. Calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Degenerative changes noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Osseous and soft tissue structures otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Enlarged cardiac silhouette could be accentuated by patient's positioning.
