Titre: Radiology Report
Indication: The patient presented with a history of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. The clinical suspicion was acute appendicitis.
Techniques: A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was conducted. The CT scan was performed using a multidetector CT scanner, and the images were reconstructed at 2.5 mm slice thickness. Oral and intravenous contrast agents were administered.
Resultat: The CT scan revealed a perforated appendix with a 1.5 cm periappendiceal abscess. There was evidence of inflammatory changes in the periappendiceal fat, but no evidence of bowel obstruction or free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The appendix was measuring 1.2 cm in diameter. The findings were consistent with acute appendicitis.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was confirmed based on the CT findings. The patient was referred to the surgical team for further management.
